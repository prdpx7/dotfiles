## What it is?
these are custom shell scripts, (bash|zsh)rc configs which i have created with the help of internet.

## How do i use these?
well, scripts are in /bin folder so  just download/clone them and set PATH to include that folder.

## /bin/
* brightness
    > set brightness from CLI
* killport
    > kill that process from port number
* transfer
    > share any file from terminal using [transfer.sh](https://transfer.sh)
* opensearch
    > searching movies,tv shows and music in opendirectories via Google
